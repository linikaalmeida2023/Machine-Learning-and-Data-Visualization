## Integrated CA Data Visualization Techniques and Machine Learning

This project is a assessment for CCT College Dublin for the integration of the modeles course (Data Visualization Techniques and Machine Learning). The focus is on the implementation of recommendation systems, market basket analysis, and the creation of an interactive dashboard using Python.

### Description
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle. It contains detailed information about customer shopping preferences, offering valuable insights into consumer behavior and purchasing patterns. The dataset includes a range of customer attributes such as age, gender, purchase history, preferred payment methods, and more.

### Main Goal

- Apply filtering techniques
- Conduct market basket analysis
- Develop an interactive dashboard for data visualization

By achieving these goals, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and enhance decision-making processes through advanced data analysis techniques.
